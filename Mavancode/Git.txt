Git vs. GitHub… what’s the difference? 
Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. 
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
