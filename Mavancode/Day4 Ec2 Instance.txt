ec2 service -> to create servers

1. type of os
2. type of instance( small or large or xlarge)
3. enable the port details for access the server -> ssh port to connect linux server
4. create the key or .pem file -> to login the server we need password that password we can use the key or .pem file

Note: key we will create only one time same key will use for every new instance or server.

AWS Ec2 instance usernames
--------------------------

os type                  usernames
-------                  ----------
centos                   centos             
redhat                   ec2-user
ubuntu                   ubuntu
amazon linux             ec2-user

Command to access the ec2 instance
-----------------------------------
ssh -i .pemkey name username of server@ip address of server

Ex: ssh -i centos.pem centos@18.191.220.59


How to login ec2 instance
-------------------------
We can use Gitbash or putty or MobaXterm to connect the ec2 instance.




EC2  --  Elastic  compute cloud
============================================

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. 


Synonyms
Computer, machine, box, PC, Server  = As per AWS terminalogy - Instance



Ex 1: Launch windows instnace
Step 1: Login to AWS  ( sunilkumark11 )
Step 2: Choose region which is near ?  ( Asia pacific - Mumbai )
Step 3: Services --  EC2
	( If any keypairs -- delete )
	( If any security groups - delete,  except default )

	Services -- EC2 --- Launch Instance 


	Stage 1  -- Select AMI  ( Note: Select free tier eligible ) Win Server 2012
	Stage 2  --  t2.micro
	Stage 3   --  No of instances  --  1
	Stage 4  --  Storage - 30GB ( Observation - we have root - it is same as C Drive)

	Stage 5  --  Add Tag --  Giving name to the machine 
			Add Name Tag
			Value - MyWindows
	Stage 6  -- Security group  --  ( It deals with ports )
			We have 0 to 65535  ports
			Every port is dedicated to special purpose

			RDP -- 3389
			SSH -- 22
			HTTP -- 80
			HTTPS - 443
			
			For windows machine , we need to open RDP port  ( Remote Desktop Protocol )
			He by default , we have RDP
			
	Stage 7		Just observe the warnings, Just verify the options, Launch


Create a new keypair--  download key pair -- launch instance

We get the instance ID  i-0dddc6c37c9dfb460
			View Instances



Now, the new windows machines ,is having its own DNS Name, Username and password


We need to provide all the above 3 details in our laptop, so that we can connect.

We use an application called Remote Desktop Connection


AWS , gives us  DNS name , username, it does not give the password.
	Instead of password , AWS has given us pem file.
	But, to connect to Window, we need password

	AWS gives an option to convert .pem to password

How to connect .pem to password
---------------------------------
Connect to instance Get password -- upload pem file -- Decrypt  



Open Remote Desktop
Computer - Provide DNS
User name  --  Administrator
password  -- c&$*LjvfdL


Hurray!!
We are connected.


Lets check the hardware configuration
CHeck hard disk
Check Ram
You can copy paste file from laptop to win server  !!

To disconnect, just close the remote desktop window.
Explain about  Stop and reboot and terminate

Launch Linux machine
-------------------------------
Create new EC2  Machine --  
If any key pairs - delete
If any security groups - delete  ( except default )

Observation:
Storage ( 30 gb for windows , 8 gb for linux )
Security Group (  RDP for windows, SSH for Linux )

AMI -  Amazon Linux 2 --->  T2.micro --> No of instance 2 -- tag - MyLinux ---> Change security group Security group name - LinSG , Description - LinSG ( optional ) - Review launch -- Create new keypair -- download key pair --  View Instances


Observation - Two machines created.
Lets change the names to   MyLinux-1, MyLinux-2

Credentials required for windows machines are (  dns,  username and password )


We use putty tool , to connect to linux machine.
And, putty required  ppk file ( Putty private key )
So, we need to convert .pem file to .ppk file.

We use puttygen  to get the ppk file.

Download from google using the  keywords "putty and puttygen"

Under alternate binary files
select putty.exe ( 64 bit )
select puttygen.exe  ( 64 bit )


Open puttygen  --  load  -- Save private key -- Save key without passphrase  ( Yes )  -- Save 

Credentials required for putty -- 
Hostname  -  username@dns       ( We get this from ssh command )

select SSH -- Auth 	-  selecy ppk file using browse option --> Open

username is - ec2-user   ( We get this from ssh command )

---
Now lets connect to 2nd linux machine 

We do not need to conver the pem to ppk, as both the machines have same pem file.

Right click on title bar of putty -- new session -- provide details -- change colors ( for easy identification )


Note: Both machines have different DNS names.
Terminate both the machines

++++++++++++++++++++++
Session terminated abnormaly.
